            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>
                The <b>Freesound Taxonomies</b> experiment is a listening test in which you are asked to categorize a number of sounds into a set of "categories". 
                These categories belong to a new <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy" style="color: black;">taxonomy</a> that we are designing
                to aid the sound description process in <a target="_blank" href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a>. 
                The purpose of the experiment is to understand whether or not our taxonomy is clear and understandable for a general audience, and how suitable it is for being integrated with Freesound.
            </p>

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The experiment consists of the following 4 phases:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1) Get familiar with the taxonomy and its categories. There are 5 top-level categories and between 3 and 10 sub categories for each top-level category.</li>
                    <li>2) Provide some basic demographic data (e.g. if you are Freesound user, a musician, etc.).</li>
                    <li>3) Select the most apporpriate category for each of the ~20 sounds that you'll be presented one by one.</li>
                    <li>4) Provide any additional textual feedback about the taxonomy (optional).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The experiment takes approximately 15-20 minutes. We suggest completing it in a single sitting.</li>
                <li>It is preferable to be located in a <i>quiet</i> environment and use headphones so you can listen to the sounds without interferences.</li>
                <li>To ensure accurate results, please refrain from using the browser's <i>back button</i> during the experiment.</li>
            </ul>
